# To-Do-List-Manager-in-Python
A To-Do List Manager is a simple application that allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. We will implement it using Python with basic file handling to store tasks persistently.

# Objectives
1. Task Management – Users can add, remove, update, and view tasks.
2. Persistent Storage – Store tasks in a file so they remain available after closing the program.
3. User-Friendly Interface – Use a simple command-line interface for interaction.

# Implementation-Steps
You can follow a step-by-step approach:

1. Create the main program file (todo_list_manager.py).
2. Define functions for adding, removing, updating, and displaying tasks.
3. Store tasks in a text file (tasks.txt).
4. Provide a menu-driven interface for users.
